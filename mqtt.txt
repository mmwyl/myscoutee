spring server:
1) spring server, handle message -> save (ignore keyUp message - action=writing (on keyUp), type=control)
2) read by eventId to list channel

3) who sent the message, the spring server sends back /channels/profile/pofileId, that the message has been sent (either firebase or mqtt)

5) check profile mqtt flag and based on that push the message to firebase notification or mqtt -> ui will handle the rest
a) when message gets saved to the db, lookup for eventid to get the members deviceId to send the notification to the devices

(on mqtt it needs to be pushed to channels/profiles/(profileId) independently -> 6 push in a row, deviceId lookup is not needed)
----------------------
b) event / car -> car changed, then send notification for the event to the members of the event
6) => acl mqtt 4) => change mongo queries to make it without limit but passing an id in the where close.
7) while querying the messages to the chat window, make members anonymous, who left the chat before,
but message being sent by them remains. event.members have to have a updatedTime, so it can be compared.
 -> male or female should be different image and based on senderId a number should be added to defferentiate
 the anonymous user from each other. members.idx? picture image big number in the middle??
8) send notification and mqtt message if the currentProfile is not in the same group then the sender's profile.
9) message is being sent only to active event members
10) if the route has mqtt, the spring server shouldn't send push to mqtt. (message.type=mqtt + currentPage = topic to be sent)

mqtt
1) auth call -> username = profileId, password is token -> call into spring -> set mqtt on profile to true -> profileId returned from the server, verify that the sent username = profileId. (libjwt)
2) on disconnect with param username -> call into spring -> set mqtt on profile false
3) mqtt server sends username always in the payload (sprintf - add on message and forward)
------
4) no acl for the time being -> acl sends url as topic param also (chat window url param) -> spring server verifies that url is for the profile.
(mongo query without limit, but with additional id param in the where close 
-> change the queries for the page accordinly with additional optional parameter.)
5) Popup notification, if you are inside chat window for different chat channel.

ui:
1) on chat window route, flag mqtt: true
it will subscribe for the channel being identified as the route name.
2) on keyup send message
3) after login create mqtt connection username=profileId, password=token
4) channel list screen and chat window ui
5) userId sould be saved in the navigation service and sent with mqtt auth as username
-----
6) when ui receives a message from spring server for the individual channel, it should know which item should update and how. (inside the list based on url or badges etc.)
(when someone reads the message sends a type=control action=read with message id.
the channel updates the item in the list on the current page based on the messageId
and clears the last message item position of the profile image about read)

angular cache:
1) ngsw json version change, index.html cache-contol no-cache should be set
2) Version your package.json file in your angular root folder
“version": “3.0.5"
3) Add output hashing every time you build your angular app.
4) ng build --outputHashing=all

spring:
1) upgrade to spring boot 3.2 (when it is released), and set spring to virtual threads (when it's released)

ssl:
1) dummy ssl for nginx on localhost -> check wss
2) certbot

done:
3) set mqtt flag true on auth, false on disconnect for the profile, and on auth return back profileId for later validation on mqtt
(disconnect hasn't got x-firebase-auth header)
the problem is token kept changing, don't want to reconnect
4) acl, disconnect should get profileId param also => X-Authorization-User on FirebaseFilter
acl should get url as topic param and action param (mqtt access flag - subscribe/unsubscribe/push/receive message)
5) username is the userId, not the profileId??, as active mqtt connection can't be changed,
and the server knows the current profileid for the user.
6) message table should contain, which member the message has been sent (type is mqtt or firebase)

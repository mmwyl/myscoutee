Bugs:

1) if nobody touches the chrome for awhile, the token will expire, and the /like call throws token expired errors
2) like is not getting saved leaving the game page, just when you return back

1) test notification on mobile, chrome browser can make port forward
2) spring subscribe to mqtt, mqtt allow ip (localhost - auth_by_ip module integrate into external_auth) and no token
3) subscribe all channels by wildchar, only locally allowed
4) spring server subscribe for all channels and save it to mongodb
5) check on desktop, how notification is being sent to laptop browser if any
6) mosquitto subscribe multiple topics in command line, check how it behaves
7) you need to scrap the shared link to show the real one, where you can attach affiliateID
when pass booking url in chat scrap the details (show the image of the room) and add affiliate id to the link.
8) does not call http, if no likes will be saved. (sync also)

1) Firebase token validation in go (username, password)
2a) if you open a chat room, than disable notification for that chat room
2b) if you close chat room send notification, don't use mqtt (close browser also - heartbeat)
2c) if main page open, the value of the notification should update the page
2d) if someone starts typing mqtt should send the message.
2e) messages sent, needs to be stored
2f) message read needs to be shown on the screen and stored (server should subscribe to all messages) - server should send a message back that the message has been received and stored - tick sign
